# Luke's build of st - the simple (suckless) terminal

The [suckless terminal (st)](https://st.suckless.org/) with some additional
features that make it literally the best terminal emulator ever:

## Unique features (using dmenu)

+ **follow urls** by pressing `alt-l`
+ **copy urls** in the same way with `alt-y`
+ **copy the output of commands** with `alt-o`

## Bindings for

+ **scrollback** with `alt-↑/↓` or `alt-pageup/down` or `shift` while scrolling the
  mouse.
+ OR **vim-bindings**: scroll up/down in history with `alt-k` and `alt-j`.
  Faster with `alt-u`/`alt-d`.
+ **zoom/change font size**: same bindings as above, but holding down shift as
  well. `alt-home` returns to default
+ **copy text** with `alt-c`, **paste** is `alt-v` or `shift-insert`

+ Compatibility with `Xresources` and `pywal` for dynamic colors.
  system font.

## Other st patches

+ Boxdraw
+ Ligatures
+ font2
+ updated to latest version 0.8.4

want transparency.

## How to configure dynamically with Xresources

For many key variables, this build of `st` will look for X settings set in
either `~/.Xdefaults` or `~/.Xresources`. You must run `xrdb` on one of these
files to load the settings.

For example, you can define your desired fonts, transparency or colors:

```
*.font:	Liberation Mono:pixelsize=12:antialias=true:autohint=true;
*.alpha: 0.9
*.color0: #111
...
```

The `alpha` value (for transparency) goes from `0` (transparent) to `1`
(opaque). There is an example `Xdefaults` file in this respository.
